      "Abstract:   we present the results of a multi lorentzian fit to the power spectra of two kilohertz qpo sources; 4u 0614+09 and 4u 1728 34. this work was triggered by recent results of a similar fit to the black hole candidates  bhcs  gx 339 4 and cyg x 1 by nowak in 2000. we find that one to six lorentzians are needed to fit the power spectra of our two sources. the use of exactly the same fit function reveals that the timing behaviour of 4u 0614+09 and 4u 1728 34 is almost identical at luminosities which are about a factor 5 different. as the characteristic frequency of the lorentzians we use the frequency nu_max at which each component contributes most of its variance per log frequency as proposed by belloni psaltis & van der klis in 2001. when using nu_max instead of the centroid frequency of the lorentzian the recently discovered hectohertz lorentzian is practically constant in frequency. we use our results to test the suggestions by respectively psaltis belloni and van der klis in 1999 and nowak in 2000 that the two lorentzians describing the high frequency end of the broad band noise in bhcs in the low state can be identified with the kilohertz qpos in the neutron star low mass x ray binaries. we find that when the two kilohertz qpos are clearly present the low frequency part of the power spectrum is too complicated to draw immediate conclusions from the nature of the components detected in any one power spectrum. however the relations we observe between the characteristic frequencies of the kilohertz qpos and the band limited noise when compared to the corresponding relations in bhcs hint towards the identification of the second highest frequency lorentzian in the bhcs with the lower kilohertz qpo. they do not confirm the identification of the highest frequency lorentzian with the upper kilohertz qpo.  \n",

      "Abstract:   using the ratios conjectures as introduced by conrey farmer and zirnbauer we obtain closed formulas for the one level density for two families of l functions attached to elliptic curves. from those closed formulas we can determine the underlying symmetry types of the families. the one level scaling density for the first family corresponds to the orthogonal distribution as predicted by the conjectures of katz and sarnak and the one level scaling density for the second family is the sum of the dirac distribution and the even orthogonal distribution. this seems to be a new phenomenon caused by the fact that the curves of the second families have odd rank. then there is a trivial zero at the central point which accounts for the dirac distribution and also affects the remaining part of the scaling density which is then  maybe surprisingly  the even orthogonal distribution. the one level density for this second family was studied in the past for test functions with fourier transforms of small support but since the fourier transforms of the even orthogonal and odd orthogonal distributions are undistinguishable for small support it was not possible to identify the distribution with those techniques. this can be done with the ratios conjectures and it sheds more light on independent and non independent zeroes and the repulsion phenomenon.  \n",

      "Abstract:   young stellar systems are known to undergo outbursts where the star experiences an increased accretion rate and the systems luminosity increases accordingly. the archetype is the fu orionis  fu ori  outburst where the accretion rate can increase by three orders of magnitude  and the brightness of the system by five magnitudes . the cause appears to be instability in the circumstellar disc but there is currently some debate as to the nature of this instability  e.g. thermal gravitational magneto rotational . this paper details high resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics  sph  simulations that were carried out to investigate the influence of stellar encounters on disc dynamics. star star encounters  where the primary has a self gravitating marginally stable protostellar disc  were simulated with various orbital parameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics. crucially the simulations include the effects of radiative transfer to realistically model the resulting thermodynamics. our results show that the accretion history and luminosity of the system during the encounter displays many of the features of outburst phenomena. in particular the magnitudes and decay times seen are comparable to those of fu ori. there are two caveats to this assertion  the first is that these events are not expected to occur frequently enough to explain all fu ori or ex lupi; the second is that the inner discs of these simulations are subject to numerical viscosity which will act to reduce the accretion rate  although it has less of an effect on the total mass accreted . in short these results cannot rule out binary interactions as a potential source of some fu ori esque outbursts.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in a recent proposal [jie and zhang phys. rev. a 95 060701 r   2017 ] it has been shown that center of mass momentum dependent two body interactions can be generated and tuned by raman coupling the closed channel bound states in a magnetic feshbach resonance. here we investigate the universal relations in a three dimensional fermi gas near such a laser modulated  $ s $  wave feshbach resonance. using the operator product expansion approach we find that to fully describe the high momentum tail of the density distribution up to  $ q^{ 6} $    $ q $  is the relative momentum  four center of mass momentum dependent parameters are required which we identify as contacts. these contacts appear in various universal relations connecting microscopic and thermodynamic properties. one contact is related to the variation of energy with respect to the inverse scattering length and determines the leading  $ q^{ 4} $  tail of the high momentum distribution. another vector contact appears in the subleading  $ q^{ 5} $  tail which is related to the velocity of closed channel molecules. the other two contacts emerge in the  $ q^{ 6} $  tail and are respectively related to the variation of energy with respect to the range parameter and to the kinetic energy of closed channel molecules. particularly we find that the  $ q^{ 5} $  tail and part of the  $ q^{ 6} $  tail of the momentum distribution show anisotropic features. we derive the universal relations and as a concrete example estimate the contacts for the zero temperature superfluid ground state of the system using a mean field approach.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we study conductance spectroscopy of a two dimensional junction between a normal metal and a strongly correlated superconductor in an applied magnetic field in the pauli limit. depending on the field strength the superconductor is either in the bardeen cooper schrieffer  bcs  or in the fulde ferrell larkin ovchinnikov  fflo  state of the fulde ferrell  ff  type. the strong correlations are accounted for by means of the gutzwiller method what leads naturally to the emergence of the spin dependent masses  sdm  of quasiparticles when the system is spin polarized. the case without strong correlations  with the spin independent masses sim  is analyzed for comparison. we consider both the s wave and the d wave symmetries of the superconducting gap and concentrate on the parallel orientation of the cooper pair momentum q with respect to the junction interface. the junction conductance is presented for selected barrier strengths  i.e. in the contact intermediate and tunneling limits . the conductance spectra in the cases with and without strong correlations differ essentially. our analysis provides thus an experimentally accessible test for the presence of strong correlations in the superconducting state. namely correlations alter the distance between the conductance peaks  or related conductance features  for carriers with spin up and spin down. in the uncorrelated case this distance is twice the zeeman energy. in the correlated case the corresponding distance is about 30 50% smaller but other models may provide even stronger difference depending on details of the system electronic structure. it turns out that the strong correlations manifest themselves most clearly in the case of the junction with the bcs rather than the fflo superconductor what should make the experimental verification of the present results simpler.  \n",

      "Abstract:   this article describes clean an approach to the detection of low energy solar neutrinos and neutrinos released from supernovae. the clean concept is based on the detection of elastic scattering events  neutrino electron scattering and neutrino nuclear scattering  in liquified noble gases such as liquid helium liquid neon and liquid xenon all of which scintillate brightly in the ultraviolet. key to the clean technique is the use of a thin film of wavelength shifting fluor to convert the ultraviolet scintillation light to the visible. this allows the same liquid to be used as both a passive shielding medium and an active self shielding detector allowing lower intrinsic radioactive backgrounds at low energies. liquid neon is a particularly promising medium for clean. because liquid neon has a high scintillation yield has no long lived radioactive isotopes and can be easily purified by use of cold traps it is an ideal medium for the detection of rare nuclear events. in addition neon is inexpensive dense and transparent to its own scintillation light making it practical for use in a large self shielding apparatus. monte carlo simulations of gamma ray backgrounds have been performed assuming liquid neon as both shielding and detection medium. gamma ray events occur with high probability in the outer parts of the detector. in contrast neutrino scattering events occur uniformly throughout the detector. we discriminate background gamma ray events from events of interest based on a spatial maximum likelihood method estimate of event location. background estimates for clean are presented as well as an evaluation of the sensitivity of the detector for  $ p p $  neutrinos. given these simulations the physics potential of the clean approach is evaluated.  \n",

      "Abstract:   by comparing 3 constituents of orion a  gas protostars and pre main sequence stars  both morhologically and kinematically we derive the following. the gas surface density near the integral shaped filament  isf  is well represented by a power law sigma b =72 msun/pc^2 b/pc ^{ 5/8} for our entire range 0.05<b/pc<8.5 of distance from the filament ridge. essentially all protostars lie on the isf or other filament ridges while almost all pre main sequence stars do not. combined with the fact that protostars move <1 kms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster this implies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from the filaments. the isf is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are progressively moving south with separations of a few myr in time and 3 pc in space. this combined with the filaments observed undulations  spatial and velocity  suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the filament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected orion a and b into stars in discrete episodes. we construct an axially symmetric gas density profile rho r =16 msun/pc^3 r/pc ^{ 13/8}. the model implies that the observed magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed undulations suggesting that the filaments transverse waves are magnetically induced. because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament on larger scales the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived. protostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the protostars not the other way around. the model also implies that the isf is kinematically young which is consistent with other lines of evidence. the southern filament has a broken power law which matches the isf profile for 2.5<b/pc<8.5 but is shallower closer in. it is also kinematically older than the isf.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we focus on the distribution regression problem  regressing to vector valued outputs from probability measures. many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework including multi instance learning and point estimation problems without analytical solution  such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation . despite the large number of available heuristics in the literature the inherent two stage sampled nature of the problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging since in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. to the best of our knowledge the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step  which often performs poorly in practice  and the domain of the distributions to be compact euclidean. in this paper we study a simple analytically computable ridge regression based alternative to distribution regression where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel hilbert space and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. our main contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two stage sampled setup under mild conditions  on separable topological domains enriched with kernels   we present an exact computational statistical efficiency trade off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one stage sampled minimax optimal rate [caponnetto and de vito 2007; steinwart et al. 2009]. this result answers a 17 year old open question establishing the consistency of the classical set kernel [haussler 1999; gaertner et. al 2002] in regression. we also cover consistency for more recent kernels on distributions including those due to [christmann and steinwart 2010].  \n",

      "Abstract:   in ultra dense small cell networks spatial multiplexing gain is a challenge because of the different propagation conditions. the channels associated with different transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i  high probability of line of sight  los  communication between user equipment  ue  and base station  bs  and ii  insufficient spacing between antenna elements at both ue and bs. in this paper we propose a novel transmission technique titled diversity pulse shaped transmission  dpst  to enhance the throughput over the correlated mimo channels in an ultra dense small cell network. the fundamental of dpst is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct interpolating filters introducing pulse shaping diversity. in dpst each antenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time offset which must be a fraction of the symbol period with respect to the adjacent antenna. the delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal generating a virtual mimo channel that benefits from increased diversity from the receiver perspective. to extract the diversity the receiver must operate in an over sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser  fse  is proposed. the joint impact of dpst and fse helps the receiver to sense a less correlated channel eventually enhancing the ues throughput. moreover in order to minimise the spatial correlation we aim to optimise the deterministic fractional delay. simulation results show that applying dpst to a correlated channel can approximately enhance the ue throughput by 1.93x and 3.76x in 2x2 and 4x4 mimo systems respectively.  \n",

      "Abstract:   observations show that nearly all star clusters and stellar populations contain blue straggler stars  bss . bss in a cluster can significantly enhance the integrated spectrum of the host population preferentially at short wavelengths and render it much bluer in photometric colours. current theoretical simple stellar population  ssp  models constructed within the traditional framework of single and binary stellar evolution cannot fully account for the impact of these objects on the integrated spectral properties of stellar populations. using conventional ssp models without taking into account bs contributions may significantly underestimate a clusters age and/or metallicity simply because one has to balance the observed bluer colours  or a bluer spectrum  with a younger age and/or a lower metallicity. therefore inclusion of bs contributions in ssp models is an important and necessary improvement for population synthesis and its applications. here we present a new set of ssp models which include bs contributions based on our analysis of individual star clusters. the models cover the wavelength range from 91~{\\aa} to 160~ $ \\mu $ m ages from 0.1 to 20 gyr and metallicities  $ z=0.0004 0.004 0.008 0.02 $   solar  and 0.05. we use the observed integrated spectra of several magellanic cloud star clusters to cross check and validate our models. the results show that the age predictions from our models are closer to those from isochrone fitting in the clusters colour magnitude diagrams compared to age predictions based on standard ssp models.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the  001 srtio3 crystal surface can be engineered to display a self organized pattern of well separated and nearly pure single terminated sro and tio2 regions by high temperature annealing in oxidizing atmosphere. by using surface sensitive techniques we have obtained evidence of such surface chemical self structuration in as prepared crystals and unambiguously identified the local composition. the contact surface potential at regions initially consisting of majority single terminations  sro and tio2  is determined to be smaller for sro than for tio2 in agreement with theoretical predictions although the measured difference below 100 mev is definitely smaller than theoretical predictions for ideally pure single terminated sro and tio2 surfaces. these relative values are maintained if samples are annealed in uhv up to 200 degrees celsius. annealing in uhv at higher temperature  400 degrees celsius  preserves the surface morphology of self assembled tio2 and sro rich regions although a non negligible chemical intermixing is observed. the most dramatic consequence is that the surface potential is reversed. it thus follows that electronic and chemical properties of  001 srtio3 widely used in oxide thin films growth can largely vary before growth starts in a manner strongly dependent on temperature and pressure conditions.  \n",

      "Abstract:   background  the electric dipole strength detected around the particle threshold and commonly associated to the pygmy dipole resonance offers a unique information on neutron skin and symmetry energy and is of astrophysical interest. the nature of such a resonance is still under debate.   purpose  we intend to describe the giant and pygmy resonances in 208 pb by enhancing their fragmentation with respect to the random phase approximation.   method  we adopt the equation of motion phonon method to perform a fully self consistent calculation in a space spanned by one phonon and two phonon basis states using an optimized chiral two body potential. a phenomenological density dependent term derived from a contact three body force is added in order to get single particle spectra more realistic than the ones obtained by using the chiral potential only. the calculation takes into full account the pauli principle and is free of spurious center of mass admixtures.   results  we obtain a fair description of the giant resonance and obtain a dense low lying spectrum in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. the transition densities as well as the phonon and particle hole composi  tion of the most strongly excited states support the pygmy nature of the low lying resonance. finally we obtain realistic values for the dipole polarizability and the neutron skin radius.   conclusions  the results emphasize the role of the two phonon states in enhancing the fragmentation of the strength in the giant resonance region and at low energy consistently with experiments. for a more detailed agreement with the data the calculation suggests the inclusion of the three phonon states as well as a fine tuning of the single particle spectrum to be obtained by a refinement of the nuclear potential.  \n",

      "Abstract:   surprising links between the deformation of 2d quantum field theories induced by the composite  $ \\textrm{t} \\bar{\\textrm{t}} $  operator effective string models and the  $ ads/ $ cft correspondence have recently emerged. the purpose of this article is to discuss various classical aspects related to the deformation of 2d interacting field theories. special attention is given to the sin h  gordon model for which we were able to construct the  $ \\textrm{t} \\bar{\\textrm{t}} $  deformed lax pair. we consider the lax pair formulation to be the first essential step toward a more satisfactory geometrical interpretation of this deformation within the integrable model framework.   furthermore it is shown that the 4d maxwell born infeld theory possibly with the addition of a mass term or a derivative independent potential corresponds to a natural extension of the 2d examples. finally we briefly comment on 2d yang mills theory and propose a modification of the heat kernel for a generic surface with genus  $ p $  and  $ n $  boundaries which fully accounts for the  $ \\textrm{t} \\bar{\\textrm{t}} $  contribution.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the relationship according to which one physical theory encompasses the domain of empirical validity of another is widely known as reduction. here it is argued that one popular methodology for showing that one theory reduces to another associated with the so called bronstein cube of physical theories rests on an over simplified characterization of the type of mathematical relationship between theories that typically underpins reduction. an alternative methodology based on a certain simple geometrical relationship between dis  tinct state space models of the same physical system is then described and illustrated with examples. within this approach it is shown how and under what conditions inter model reductions involving distinct model pairs can be composed or chained together to yield a direct reduction between theoretically remote descriptions of the same system. building on this analysis we consider cases in which a single reduction between two models may be effected via distinct composite reductions differing in their intermediate layer of description and motivate a set of formal consistency requirements on the mappings between model state spaces and on the subsets of the model state spaces that characterize such reductions. these constraints are explicitly shown to hold in the reduction of a non relativistic classical model to a model of relativistic quantum mechanics which may be effected via distinct composite reductions in which the intermediate layer of description is either a model of non relativistic quantum mechanics or of relativistic classical mechanics. some brief speculations are offered as to whether and how this sort of consistency requirement between distinct composite reductions might serve to constrain the relationship that any unification of the standard model with general relativity must bear to these theories.  \n",

      "Abstract:   many embedded star clusters do not evolve into long lived bound clusters. the most popular explanation for this infant mortality of young clusters is the expulsion of natal gas by stellar winds and supernovae which leaves up to 90% of them unbound. a cluster disruption model has recently been proposed in which this mass  independent disruption of clusters proceeds for another gyr after gas expulsion. in this scenario the survival chances of massive clusters are much smaller than in the traditional mass dependent disruption models. the most common way to study cluster disruption is to use the cluster age distribution which however can be heavily affected by incompleteness. to avoid this we introduce a new method based on size of sample effects namely the relation between the most massive cluster m_max and the age range sampled. assuming that clusters are sampled from a power law initial mass function with index  2 and that the cluster formation rate is constant m_max scales with the age range sampled such that the slope in a log m_max  vs. log age  plot is equal to unity. this slope decreases if mass independent disruption is included. for 90% mass independent cluster disruption per age dex the predicted slope is zero. for the solar neighbourhood smc lmc m33 and m83 based on ages and masses taken from the literature we find slopes consistent with the expected size of sample correlations for the first 100 myr hence ruling out the 90% mass independent cluster disruption scenario. for m51 however the increase of log m_max  with log age  is slightly shallower and for the antennae galaxies it is flat. this simple method shows that the formation and/or disruption of clusters in the antennae must have been very different from that of the other galaxies studied here so it should not be taken as a representative case.  \n",

      "Abstract:   using long slit optical spectra obtained with the 2 m telescope at iucaa girawali observatory we show that the radio source j094221.98+062335.2  z=0.123  is associated with a galaxy pair undergoing a major merger. its companion is a normal star forming galaxy infalling with a velocity of 185 km/s at a projected separation of 4.8 kpc. using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope  wsrt  and giant metrewave radio telescope  gmrt  we detect a strong hi 21 cm absorption at the systemic redshift of the radio galaxy with n hi ~9x10^21 cm^{ 2} for an assumed spin temperature of 100 k. such a strong hi 21 cm absorption is rare and has been seen only in a few compact radio sources associated with similar merging galaxy pairs. milliarcsecond resolution very long baseline array  vlba  observations resolve the radio source into a compact symmetric object with the hotspot separation of 89 pc. the 21 cm absorption is detected in the vlba spectra towards both the radio lobes albeit with a strong optical depth gradient. we show that the strong 21 cm absorption is consistent with it being arising from a clumpy circumnuclear disk/torus. we also detect two weaker absorption lines redshifted with respect to the radio source in the wsrt/gmrt spectrum. they probably represent cold  i.e. t< 10^4 k  hi gas falling into the radio source. the presence of high concentration of hi gas in the circumnuclear regions and signature of infalling cold gas allows us to conjecture that the young radio source may have been triggered by the gas infall due to the ongoing merger.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in this paper i intend to show that macroscopic entanglement is possible at high temperatures. i analyze multipartite entanglement produced by the  $ \\eta $  pairing mechanism which features strongly in the fermionic lattice models of high  $ t_c $  superconductivity. this problem is shown to be equivalent to calculating multipartite entanglement in totally symmetric states of qubits. i demonstrate that we can conclusively calculate the relative entropy of entanglement within any subset of qubits in an overall symmetric state. three main results then follow. first i show that the condition for superconductivity namely the existence of the off diagonal long range order  odlro  is not dependent on two site entanglement but on just classical correlations as the sites become more and more distant. secondly the entanglement that does survive in the thermodynamical limit is the entanglement of the total lattice and at half filling it scales with the log of the number of sites. it is this entanglement that will exist at temperatures below the superconducting critical temperature which can currently be as high as 160 kelvin. thirdly i prove that a complete mixture of symmetric states does not contain any entanglement in the macroscopic limit. on the other hand the same mixture of symmetric states possesses the same two qubit entanglement features as the pure states involved in the sense that the mixing does not destroy entanglement for finite number of qubits albeit it does decrease it. maximal mixing of symmetric states also does not destroy odlro and classical correlations. i discuss various other inequalities between different entanglements as well as generalizations to the subsystems of any dimensionality  i.e. higher than spin half .  \n",

      "Abstract:   the business intelligence and decision support systems used in many application domains casually rely on data warehouses which are decision oriented data repositories modeled as multidimensional  md  structures. md structures help navigate data through hierarchical levels of detail. in many real world situations hierarchies in md models are complex which causes data aggregation issues collectively known as the summarizability problem. this problem leads to incorrect analyses and critically affects decision making. to enforce summarizability existing approaches alter either md models or data and must be applied a priori on a case by case basis by an expert. to alter neither models nor data a few query time approaches have been proposed recently but they only detect summarizability issues without solving them. thus we propose in this paper a novel approach that automatically detects and processes summarizability issues at query time without requiring any particular expertise from the user. moreover while most existing approaches are based on the relational model our approach focus on an xml md model since xml data is customarily used to represent business data and its format better copes with complex hierarchies than the relational model. finally our experiments show that our method is likely to scale better than a reference approach for addressing the summarizability problem in the md context.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the dark side of the universe is mysterious and its nature is still unknown. in fact this poses perhaps as the biggest challenge in the modern cosmology. the two components of the dark sector  dark matter and dark energy  correspond today to around ninety five percent of the universe. the simplest dark energy candidate is a cosmological constant. however this attempt presents a huge discrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the theoretical prediction and the observed data. such a huge disparity motivates physicists to look into a more sophisticated models. this can be done either looking for a deeper understanding of where the cosmological constant comes from if one wants to derive it from first principles or considering other possibilities for accelerated expansion such as modifications of general relativity additional matter fields and so on. still regarding a dynamical dark energy there may exist a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter since their densities are comparable and depending on the coupling used the interaction can also alleviate the issue of why dark energy and matter densities are of the same order today. phenomenological models have been widely explored in the literature. on the other hand field theory models that aim a consistent description of the dark energy/dark matter interaction are still few. in this thesis we explore either a scalar or a vector field as a dark energy candidate in several different approaches taking into account a possible interaction between the two components of the dark sector. this thesis is based on the following papers  1611.00428 1605.03550 1509.04980 1508.07248 1507.00902 and 1505.03243. the author also collaborated in the works 1607.03506 and 1605.05264.  \n",

      "Abstract:   directed graphical models provide a useful framework for modeling causal or directional relationships for multivariate data. prior work has largely focused on identifiability and search algorithms for directed acyclic graphical  dag  models. in many applications feedback naturally arises and directed graphical models that permit cycles occur. in this paper we address the issue of identifiability for general directed cyclic graphical  dcg  models satisfying the markov assumption. in particular in addition to the faithfulness assumption which has already been introduced for cyclic models we introduce two new identifiability assumptions one based on selecting the model with the fewest edges and the other based on selecting the dcg model that entails the maximum number of d separation rules. we provide theoretical results comparing these assumptions which show that   1  selecting models with the largest number of d separation rules is strictly weaker than the faithfulness assumption;  2  unlike for dag models selecting models with the fewest edges does not necessarily result in a milder assumption than the faithfulness assumption. we also provide connections between our two new principles and minimality assumptions. we use our identifiability assumptions to develop search algorithms for small scale dcg models. our simulation study supports our theoretical results showing that the algorithms based on our two new principles generally out perform algorithms based on the faithfulness assumption in terms of selecting the true skeleton for dcg models.  \n",

      "Abstract:   through this research embedded synthetic fracture networks in rock masses are studied. to analysis the fluid flow complexity in fracture networks with respect to the variation of connectivity patterns two different approaches are employed namely the lattice boltzmann method and graph theory. the lattice boltzmann method is used to show the sensitivity of the permeability and fluid velocity distribution to synthetic fracture networks connectivity patterns. furthermore the fracture networks are mapped into the graphs and the characteristics of these graphs are compared to the main spatial fracture networks. among different characteristics of networks we distinguish the modularity of networks and sub graphs distributions. we map the flow regimes into the proper regions of the networks modularity space. also for each type of fluid regime corresponding motifs shapes are scaled. implemented power law distributions of fracture length in spatial fracture networks yielded the same nodes degree distribution in transformed networks. two general spatial networks are considered  random networks and networks with hubness properties mimicking a spatial damage zone  both with power law distribution of fracture length . in the first case the fractures are embedded in uniformly distributed fracture sets; the second case covers spatial fracture zones. we prove numerically that the abnormal change  transition  in permeability is controlled by the hub growth rate. also comparing lbm results with the characteristic mean length of transformed networks links shows a reverse relationship between the aforementioned parameters. in addition the abnormalities in advection through nodes are presented.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in previous work we have argued that the optical properties of moderately doped two dimensional semiconductors can be described in terms of excitons dressed by their interactions with a degenerate fermi sea of additional charge carriers. these interactions split the bare exciton into attractive and repulsive exciton polaron branches. the collective excitations of the coupled system are many body generalizations of the bound trion and unbound states of a single electron interacting with an exciton. in this article we consider exciton polarons in the presence of an external magnetic field that quantizes the kinetic energy of the electrons in the fermi sea. our theoretical approach is based on a transformation to new basis that respects the underlying symmetry of magnetic translations. we find that the attractive exciton polaron branch is only weakly influenced by the magnetic field whereas the repulsive branch exhibits magnetic oscillations and splits into discrete peaks that reflect combined exciton cyclotron resonance.  \n",

      "Abstract:   scalability issues may prevent users from verifying critical properties of a complex hardware design. in this situation we propose to synthesize a safety shield that is attached to the design to enforce the properties at run time. shield synthesis can succeed where model checking and reactive synthesis fail because it only considers a small set of critical properties as opposed to the complex design or the complete specification in the case of reactive synthesis. the shield continuously monitors the input/output of the design and corrects its erroneous output only if necessary and as little as possible so other non critical properties are likely to be retained. although runtime enforcement has been studied in other domains such as action systems reactive systems pose unique challenges where the shield must act without delay. we thus present the first shield synthesis solution for reactive hardware systems and report our experimental results. this is an extended version of [5] featuring an additional appendix.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we revisit the traditional upwind schemes for linear conservation laws in the viewpoint of jump processes allowing studying upwind schemes using probabilistic tools. in particular for fokker planck equations on  $ \\mathbb{r} $  in the case of weak confinement we show that the solution of upwind scheme converges to a stationary solution. in the case of strong confinement using a discrete poincar\\e inequality we prove that the  $ o h  $  numeric error under  $ \\ell^1 $  norm is uniform in time and establish the uniform exponential convergence to the steady states. compared with the traditional results of exponential convergence of upwind schemes our result is in the whole space without boundary. we also establish similar results on torus for which the stationary solution of the scheme does not have detailed balance. this work shows an interesting connection between standard numerical methods and time continuous markov chains and could motivate better understanding of numerical analysis for conservation laws.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in this paper we study lower bounds on the k theory of the maximal  $ c^* $  algebra of a discrete group based on the amount of torsion it contains. we call this the finite part of the operator k theory and give a lower bound that is valid for a large class of groups called the finitely embeddable groups. the class of finitely embeddable groups includes all residually finite groups amenable groups gromovs monster groups virtually torsion free groups  e.g.  $ out f_n  $   and any group of analytic diffeomorphisms of an analytic connected manifold fixing a given point. it is an open question if every countable group is finitely embeddable. we apply this result to measure the degree of non rigidity for any compact oriented manifold  $ m $  with dimension  $ 4k 1 $   $  k>1  $ . we derive a lower bound on the rank of the structure group  $ s m  $  in this case. for a compact riemannian manifold  $ m $  with dimension greater than or equal to 5 and positive scalar curvature metric there is an abelian group  $ p m  $  that measures the size of the space of all positive scalar curvature metrics on  $ m $ . we obtain a lower bound on the rank of the abelian group  $ p m  $  when the compact smooth spin manifold  $ m $  has dimension  $ 2k 1 $   $  k>2  $  and the fundamental group of  $ m $  is finitely embeddable.  \n",

[21]  long range dependent sequences  doukhan et al. [23] samorodnitsky [54]  empirical processes  dehling et al. [22]  and more general structures  eberlein and taqqu [25]  to name a few references. a smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory under extremal dependence for point processes maxima partial sums tail empirical processes. resnick [49 50] started a systematic study of the relations between the convergence of point processes sums and maxima see also resnick [51] for a recent account. he advocated the use of multivariate regular variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy tail phenomena combined with advanced continuous mapping techniques. for example maxima and sums are understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process if the point process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. davis and hsing [13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes maxima sums and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes i.e. stationary sequences whose finite dimensional distributions are regularly varying with the same index. before [13] limit theory for particular regularly varying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean maxima sample autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes with iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for regularly varying arch processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence equation see rootz\\en [53] davis and 1991 mathematics subject classification. primary 60f10 60g70 secondary 60f05. key words and phrases. large deviation principle regularly varying processes central limit theorem ruin probabilities garch.  \n",

      "Abstract:   a common criterion in the design of finite hilbert space frames is minimal coherence as this leads to error reduction in various signal processing applications. frames that achieve minimal coherence relative to all unit norm frames are called grassmannian frames a class which includes the well known equiangular tight frames. however the notion of coherence minimization varies according to the constraints of the ambient optimization problem so there are other types of minimally coherent frames one can speak of. in addition to grassmannian frames we consider the class of frames which minimize coherence over the space of frames which are both unit norm and tight which we call 1 grassmannian frames. we observe that these two types of frames coincide in many settings but not all; accordingly we investigate some of the differences between the resulting theories. for example one noteworthy advantage enjoyed by 1 grassmannian frames is that their optimality properties are preserved under the naimark complement.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the schmidt kennicutt relation links the surface densities of gas to the star formation rate in galaxies. the physical origin of this relation and in particular its break i.e. the transition between an inefficient regime at low gas surface densities and a main regime at higher densities remains debated. here we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaks in several low redshift galaxies from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. we use numerical simulations representative of the milky way the large and the small magellanic clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution and which reproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations of the star formation thresholds. we analyze the role of interstellar turbulence gas cooling and geometry in drawing these relations at 100 pc scale. we suggest in particular that the existence of a break in the schmidt  kennicutt relation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonic turbulence and is independent of self shielding effects. this transition being connected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity the break is shifted toward high surface densities in metal poor galaxies as observed in dwarf galaxies. our results suggest that together with the collapse of clouds under self gravity turbulence  injected at galactic scale  can induce the compression of gas and regulate star formation.  \n",

      "Abstract:   many applications want to use tcp congestion control to regulate the transmission rate of a data packet stream. a natural way to achieve this goal is to transport the data packet stream on a tcp connection. however because tcp implements both congestion and error control transporting a data packet stream directly using a tcp connection forces the data packet stream to be subject to tcps other properties caused by tcp error control which may be inappropriate for these applications.   the tcp decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of applying tcp congestion control to a data packet stream without actually transporting the data packet stream on a tcp connection. instead a tcp connection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up separately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then associated with that of the tcp packets. since the transmission rate of these tcp packets is under tcp congestion control so is that of the data packet stream. furthermore since the data packet stream is not transported on a tcp connection the regulated data packet stream is not subject to tcp error control.   because of this flexibility the tcp decoupling approach opens up many new opportunities solves old problems and improves the performance of some existing applications. all of these advantages will be demonstrated in the thesis.   this thesis presents the design implementation and analysis of the tcp decoupling approach and its successful applications in tcp trunking wireless communication and multimedia streaming.  \n",

      "Abstract:   gravitational wave `echoes during black hole merging events have been advocated as possible signals of modifications to gravity in the strong field  but semiclassical  regime. in these proposals the observable effect comes entirely from the appearance of nonzero reflection probability at the horizon which vanishes for a standard black hole. we show how to apply eft reasoning to these arguments using and extending earlier work for localized systems that relates choices of boundary condition to the action for the physics responsible for these boundary conditions. eft reasoning applied to this action argues that linear `robin boundary conditions dominate at low energies and we determine the relationship between the corresponding effective coupling  whose value is the one relevant low energy prediction of particular modifications to general relativity for these systems  and the phenomenologically measurable near horizon reflection coefficient. because this connection involves only near horizon physics it is comparatively simple to establish and we do so for perturbations in both the schwarzschild geometry  which is the one most often studied theoretically  and the kerr geometry  which is the one of observational interest for post merger ring down . in passing we identify the renormalization group evolution of the effective couplings as a function of a regularization distance from the horizon that enforces how physics does not depend on the precise position where the boundary conditions are imposed. we show that the perfect absorber/perfect emitter boundary conditions of general relativity correspond to the only fixed points of this evolution. nontrivial running of all other rg evolution reflects how modifications to gravity necessarily introduce new physics near the horizon.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in a feshbach resonance the effective s wave scattering length grows when one moves toward the resonance point and eventually diverges at this point. there is one characteristic energy scale  $ \\delta_c $  defined as in the negative side of the resonance point the detuning energy at which the weight of the bound state shifts from predominatedly in the open channel to predominated in the closed channel. when the many body energy scale  e.g. the fermi energy  $ e_{f} $   is larger than  $ \\delta_c $  the closed channel weight is significant and has to be included in the many body theory. furthermore when two channels share a hyperfine species the pauli exclusion between fermions from two channels also needs to be taken into consideration in the many body theory.   the current thesis addresses the above problem in detail. a set of gap equations and number equations are derived at the mean field level. the fermionic and bosonic excitation spectra are then derived. assuming that the uncoupled bound state of the closed channel in resonance is much smaller than the inter particle distance as well as the s wave scattering length  $ a_s $  we find that the basic equations in the single channel crossover model are still valid. the correction first comes from the existing of the finite chemical potential and additional counting complication due to the closed channel. these two corrections need to be included into the mean field equations i.e. the gap equations and the number equations and be solved self consistently. then the correction due to the inter channel pauli exclusion is in the order of the ratio of the fermi energy and the zeeman energy difference between two channels  $ e_f/\\eta $  which can be analyzed perturbatively over the previous corrections.   fermionic and bosonic excitation modes are studied.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we carried out a detailed and continuous paleomagnetic sampling of the reversed to normal geomagnetic transition recorded by some 60 consecutive flow units near the base of the lesotho basalt  183 &#61617; 1 ma . after alternating field or thermal cleaning the directions of remanence are generally well clustered within flow units. in contrast the thermal instability of the samples did not allow to obtain reliable paleointensity determinations. the geomagnetic transition is incompletely recorded due to a gap in volcanic activity attested both by eolian deposits and a large angular distance between the field directions of the flows underlying or overlying these deposits. the transition path is noticeably different from that reported in the pioneer work of van zijl et al.  1962 . the most transitional virtual geomagnetic poles are observed after the volcanic hiatus. once continents are replaced in their relative position 180 ma ago the post hiatus vgp cluster over russia. however two successive rebounds from that cluster are found with vgp reaching repeatedly eastern asia coast. thus the vgp path is not narrowly constrained in paleolongitude. the decrease in intensity of magnetization as the field deviates from the normal or reversed direction suggests that the decrease in field magnitude during the reversal reached 80 90%. we conclude that although the reversal is of a dipole of much weaker moment than that which existed on average during cenozoic time the characteristics of the reversing geodynamo seem to be basically similar.  \n",

      "Abstract:   spin foam models are an attempt for a covariant or path integral formulation of canonical loop quantum gravity. the construction of such models usually rely on the plebanski formulation of general relativity as a constrained bf theory and is based on the discretization of the action on a simplicial triangulation which may be viewed as an ultraviolet regulator. the triangulation dependence can be removed by means of group field theory techniques which allows one to sum over all triangulations. the main tasks for these models are the correct quantum implementation of the plebanski constraints the existence of a semiclassical sector implementing additional regge like constraints arising from simplicial triangulations and the definition of the physical inner product of loop quantum gravity via group field theory. here we propose a new approach to tackle these issues stemming directly from the holst action for general relativity which is also a proper starting point for canonical loop quantum gravity. the discretization is performed by means of a cubulation of the manifold rather than a triangulation. we give a direct interpretation of the resulting spin foam model as a generating functional for the n point functions on the physical hilbert space at finite regulator. this paper focuses on ideas and tasks to be performed before the model can be taken seriously. however our analysis reveals some interesting features of this model  first the structure of its amplitudes differs from the standard spin foam models. second the tetrad n point functions admit a wick like structure. third the restriction to simple representations does not automatically occur    unless one makes use of the time gauge just as in the classical theory.  \n",

      "Abstract:   efficient dynamic spectrum access mechanism is crucial for improving the spectrum utilization. in this paper we consider the dynamic spectrum access mechanism design with both complete and incomplete network information. when the network information is available we propose an evolutionary spectrum access mechanism. we use the replicator dynamics to study the dynamics of channel selections and show that the mechanism achieves an equilibrium that is an evolutionarily stable strategy and is also max min fair. with incomplete network information we propose a distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for dynamic spectrum access. each secondary user applies the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate its expected payoff based on the local observations and learns to adjust its mixed strategy for channel selections adaptively over time. we study the convergence of the learning mechanism based on the theory of stochastic approximation and show that it globally converges to an approximate nash equilibrium. numerical results show that the proposed evolutionary spectrum access and distributed reinforcement learning mechanisms achieve up to 82% and 70% performance improvement than a random access mechanism respectively and are robust to random perturbations of channel selections.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the essentially non oscillatory  eno  method is an efficient high order numerical method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws designed to reduce the gibbs oscillations if existent by adaptively choosing the local stencil for the interpolation. the original eno method is constructed based on the polynomial interpolation and the overall rate of convergence provided by the method is uniquely determined by the total number of interpolation points involved for the approximation. in this paper we propose simple non polynomial eno and weighted eno  weno  finite volume methods in order to enhance the local accuracy and convergence. we first adopt the infinitely smooth radial basis functions  rbfs  for a non polynomial interpolation. particularly we use the multi quadric and gaussian rbfs. the non polynomial interpolation such as the rbf interpolation offers the flexibility to control the local error by optimizing the free parameter. then we show that the non polynomial interpolation can be represented as a perturbation of the polynomial interpolation. that is it is not necessary to know the exact form of the non polynomial basis for the interpolation. in this paper we formulate the eno and weno methods based on the non polynomial interpolation and derive the optimization condition of the perturbation. to guarantee the essentially non oscillatory property we switch the non polynomial reconstruction to the polynomial reconstruction adaptively near the non smooth area by using the monotone polynomial interpolation method. the numerical results show that the developed non polynomial eno and weno methods enhance the local accuracy.  \n",

      "Abstract:   co observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in external galaxies but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely underestimated. at present the kinematic information of co data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds. millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil h2 envelopes lacking co. these different tracers must be compared in different environments. this study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission in two gmc samples  the local molecular clouds in our galaxy and their equivalents in the small magellanic cloud  smc  one of the nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. in our galaxy mass estimates deduced from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. virial masses are systematically larger  twice on average  than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. this difference decreases toward high masses and has already been reported in previous studies. in the smc however molecular cloud masses deduced from simba millimeter observations are systematically higher  twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity  than the virial masses from sest co observations. the observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. taking a general form for the virial theorem we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15 micro gauss in smc clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed. masses of smc molecular clouds have therefore been underestimated so far. magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to their support.  \n",

      "Abstract:   accelerating polarized proton beams and storing them for many turns can lead to a loss of polarization when accelerating through energies where a spin rotation frequency is in resonance with orbit oscillation frequencies. first order resonance effects can be avoided by installing siberian snakes in the ring devices which rotate the spin by 180 degrees around the snake axis while not changing the beams orbit significantly. for large rings several siberian snakes are required.   here a criterion will be derived that allows to find an optimal choice of the snake axes. rings with super period four are analyzed in detail and the hera proton ring is used as an example for approximate four fold symmetry. the proposed arrangement of siberian snakes matches their effects so that all spin orbit coupling integrals vanish at all energies and therefore there is no first order spin orbit coupling at all for this choice which i call snakes matching. it will be shown that in general at least eight siberian snakes are needed and that there are exactly four possibilities to arrange their axes. when the betatron phase advance between snakes is chosen suitably four siberian snakes can be sufficient.   to show that favorable choice of snakes have been found polarized protons are tracked for part of hera ps acceleration cycle which shows that polarization is preserved best for the here proposed arrangement of siberian snakes.  \n",

      "Abstract:   dark matter believed to be present in many galaxies is interpreted as a hydrodynamical system in interaction with the gravitational field and with nothing else. the gravitational field of our galaxy can be inferred from observation of orbital velocities of the visible stars in a first approximation in which the field is taken to be due to the distribution of dark matter only. an equation of state is determined by the gravitational field via the equations of motion.   to arrive at an estimate of the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy and simultaneously learn something about the gravitational field in the inner regions the following strategy was adopted  1. the observed rotation curves suggest an expression for the newtonian potential valid in the outer region. 2. the assumption of a quasi stationary spherically symmetric distribution of dark matter then leads to a unique equation of state. 3. this equation of state is assumed to be valid all the way to the center  though of course the newtonian approximation is not . 4. using this equation of state together with einsteins equations and the relativistic hydrostatic condition we calculate the metric and the matter density throughout the galaxy. the solutions are regular all the way to the center; there is no indication of a structure of the type of a black hole.   the equation of state that is thus determined experimentally is of the type used by chandrasekhar and others for the degenerate fermi gas. in the approximation of weak fields the associated sinh emden equation has a global nonsingular solution.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the origin and evolution of supernova remnants of the mixed morphology class is not well understood. several remnants present distorted radio or x ray shells with jet like structures. g290.1 0.8  msh 11 61a  belongs to this class. we aim to investigate the nature of this supernova remnant in order to unveil the origin of its particular morphology. we based our work on the study of the x ray emitting plasma properties and the conditions imposed by the cold interstellar medium where the remnant expanded. we use archival radio hi line data and x ray observations from xmm newton and chandra observatories to study g290.1 0.8 and its surrounding medium. spatially resolved spectral analysis and mean photon energy maps are used to obtain physical and geometrical parameters of the source. radio continuum and hi line maps give crucial information to understand the radio/x ray morphology. the x ray images show that the remnant presents two opposite symmetric bright spots on a symmetry axis running towards the nw se direction. spectral analysis and mean photon energy maps confirm that the physical conditions of the emitting plasma are not homogeneous throughout the remnant. in fact both bright spots have higher temperatures than the rest of the plasma and its constituents have not reached ionization equilibrium yet. hi line data reveal low density tube like structures aligned along the same direction. this evidence supports the idea that the particular x ray morphology observed is a direct consequence of the structure of the interstellar medium where the remnant evolved. however the possibility that an undetected point like object as a neutron star exists within the remnant and contributes to the x ray emission cannot be discarded. finally we suggest that a supernova explosion due to the collapse of a high mass star with a strong bipolar wind can explain the supernova remnant morphology.  \n",

      "Abstract:   x ray and near ir surveys of the central 2x0.8 degrees of the galactic centre have revealed a population of x ray bright massive stars. however the nature of the emission originating in a wind collision zone or via accretion onto a compact object is uncertain. in order to address this we investigated the nature of the luminous x ray source cxogc j174536.1 285638. an analysis of the near ir spectrum with a non lte model atmosphere code demonstrated that it was an highly luminous wn9h star for which comparison to evolutionary tracks suggests an age of 2 2.5myr and an initial mass of ~110msun. the x ray properties of cxogc j174536.1 285638 resemble those of 3 of the wn9h stars within the arches cluster and in turn other very massive wnlh colliding wind binaries. simple analytical arguments demonstrate consistency between the x ray emission and a putative wn9h+mid o v iii binary. however we may not exclude a high mass x ray binary interpretation which if correct would provide a unique insight into the  post sn  evolution of extremely massive stars. irrespective of the nature of the secondary cxogc j174536.1 285638 adds to the growing list of known and candidate wnlh binaries. of the subset of wnlh stars subject to a radial velocity survey we find a lower limit to the binary fraction of ~45%; of interest for studies of massive stellar formation given that they currently possess the highest dynamically determined masses of any type of star.

      "Abstract:   the independent component analysis  ica  algorithm is implemented as a neural network for separating signals of different origin in astrophysical sky maps. due to its self organizing capability it works without prior assumptions on the signals neither on their frequency scaling nor on the signal maps themselves; instead it learns directly from the input data how to separate the physical components making use of their statistical independence. to test the capabilities of this approach we apply the ica algorithm on sky patches taken from simulations and observations at the microwave frequencies that are going to be deeply explored in a few years on the whole sky by the microwave anisotropy probe  map  and by the {\\sc planck} surveyor satellite. the maps are at the frequencies of the low frequency instrument  lfi  aboard the {\\sc planck} satellite  30 44 70 and 100 ghz  and contain simulated astrophysical radio sources cosmic microwave background  cmb  radiation and galactic diffuse emissions from thermal dust and synchrotron. we show that the ica algorithm is able to recover each signal with precision going from 10% for the galactic components to percent for cmb; radio sources are almost completely recovered down to a flux limit corresponding to  $ 0.7\\sigma_{cmb} $  where  $ \\sigma_{cmb} $  is the rms level of cmb fluctuations. the signal recovering possesses equal quality on all the scales larger then the pixel size. in addition we show that the frequency scalings of the input signals can be partially inferred from the ica outputs at the percent precision for the dominant components radio sources and cmb.  \n",

      "Abstract:   studies of social and group behavior in interacting organisms require high throughput analysis of the motion of a large number of individual subjects. computer vision techniques offer solutions to specific tracking problems and allow automated and efficient tracking with minimal human intervention. in this work we adopt the open active contour model to track the trajectories of moving objects at high density. we add repulsive interactions between open contours to the original model treat the trajectories as an extrusion in the temporal dimension and show applications to two tracking problems. the walking behavior of drosophila is studied at different population density and gender composition. we demonstrate that individual male flies have distinct walking signatures and that the social interaction between flies in a mixed gender arena is gender specific. we also apply our model to studies of trajectories of gliding myxococcus xanthus bacteria at high density. we examine the individual gliding behavioral statistics in terms of the gliding speed distribution. using these two examples at very distinctive spatial scales we illustrate the use of our algorithm on tracking both short rigid bodies  drosophila  and long flexible objects  myxococcus xanthus . our repulsive active membrane model reaches error rates better than  $ 5\\times 10^{ 6} $  per fly per second for drosophila tracking and comparable results for myxococcus xanthus.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we obtained follow up hst observations of the seven low surface brightness galaxies discovered with the dragonfly telephoto array in the field of the massive spiral galaxy m101. out of the seven galaxies only three were resolved into stars and are potentially associated with the m101 group at  $ d=7\\text{ mpc} $ . based on hst acs photometry in the broad f606w and f814w filters we use a maximum likelihood algorithm to locate the tip of the red giant branch  trgb  in galaxy color magnitude diagrams. distances are  $ 6.38^{+0.35}_{ 0.35} 6.87^{+0.21}_{ 0.30} $  and  $ 6.52^{+0.25}_{ 0.27} \\text{ mpc} $  and we confirm that they are members of the m101 group. combining the three confirmed low luminosity satellites with previous results for brighter group members we find the m101 galaxy group to be a sparsely populated galaxy group consisting of seven group members down to  $ m_v =  9.2 \\text{ mag} $ . we compare the m101 cumulative luminosity function to that of the milky way and m31. we find that they are remarkably similar; in fact the cumulative luminosity function of the m101 group gets even flatter for fainter magnitudes and we show that the m101 group might exhibit the two known small scale flaws in the  $ \\lambda\\textrm{cdm} $  model namely `the missing satellite problem and the `too big to fail problem. kinematic measurements of m101 $  $ s satellite galaxies are required to determine whether the `too big to fail problem does in fact exist in the m101 group.  \n",

      "Abstract:   mathematical models of cellular physiological mechanisms often involve random walks on graphs representing transitions within networks of functional states. schmandt and gal\\{a}n recently introduced a novel stochastic shielding approximation as a fast accurate method for generating approximate sample paths from a finite state markov process in which only a subset of states are observable. for example in ion channel models such as the hodgkin huxley or other conductance based neural models a nerve cell has a population of ion channels whose states comprise the nodes of a graph only some of which allow a transmembrane current to pass. the stochastic shielding approximation consists of neglecting fluctuations in the dynamics associated with edges in the graph not directly affecting the observable states. we consider the problem of finding the optimal complexity reducing mapping from a stochastic process on a graph to an approximate process on a smaller sample space as determined by the choice of a particular linear measurement functional on the graph. the partitioning of ion channel states into conducting versus nonconducting states provides a case in point. in addition to establishing that schmandt and gal\\{a}ns approximation is in fact optimal in a specific sense we use recent results from random matrix theory to provide heuristic error estimates for the accuracy of the stochastic shielding approximation for an ensemble of random graphs. moreover we provide a novel quantitative measure of the contribution of individual transitions within the reaction graph to the accuracy of the approximate process.  \n",

      "Abstract:   data from seven data storage tags recovered from atlantic salmon marked as smolts were analyzed for depth movements and patterns of deep diving during the marine migration. the salmon mostly stayed at the surface and showed diurnal activity especially from autumn until spring. during the first months at sea the salmon stayed at shallower depths  < 100 m . the salmon took short deep dives  > 100 m  that were rare or absent during the first summer at sea but increased in frequency and duration especially in late winter. the maximum depth of the dives varied from 419 to 1187 m. most of dives were short  < 5 hours  but could last up to 33 hours. the duration of dives increased in late winter until spring and the overall depth and maximum depth per dive increased exponentially over time. the initiation of the dives was more common in evenings and at night suggesting nocturnal diving. we hypothesized that deep diving is related to feeding of salmon as mesopelagic fish can be important food for salmon during winter.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the polar vortices play a crucial role in the formation of the ozone hole and can cause severe weather anomalies. their boundaries known as the vortex `edges are typically identified via methods that are either frame dependent or return non material structures and hence are unsuitable for assessing material transport barriers. using two dimensional velocity data on isentropic surfaces in the northern hemisphere we show that elliptic lagrangian coherent structures  lcss  identify the correct outermost material surface dividing the coherent vortex core from the surrounding incoherent surf zone. despite the purely kinematic construction of lcss we find a remarkable contrast in temperature and ozone concentration across the identified vortex boundary. we also show that potential vorticity based methods despite their simplicity misidentify the correct extent of the vortex edge. finally exploiting the shrinkage of the vortex at various isentropic levels we observe a trend in the magnitude of vertical motion inside the vortex which is consistent with previous results.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we consider a simple gravitational heating mechanism for the long term quenching of cooling flows and star formation in massive dark matter haloes hosting ellipticals and clusters. the virial shock heating in haloes >10^12 mo triggers quenching in 10^12 13 mo haloes  birnboim dekel & neistein 2007 . we show that the long term quenching in haloes >mmin~7x10^12 mo could be due to the gravitational energy of cosmological accretion delivered to the inner halo hot gas by cold flows via ram pressure drag and local shocks. mmin is obtained by comparing the gravitational power of infall into the potential well with the overall radiative cooling rate. the heating wins if the gas inner density cusp is not steeper than r^ 0.5 and if the masses in the cold and hot phases are comparable. the effect is stronger at higher redshifts making the maintenance easier also at later times. clumps >10^5 mo penetrate to the inner halo with sufficient kinetic energy before they disintegrate but they have to be <10^8 mo for the drag to do enough work in a hubble time. pressure confined ~10^4k clumps are stable against their own gravity and remain gaseous once below the bonnor ebert mass ~10^8 mo. they are also immune to tidal disruption. clumps in the desired mass range could emerge by thermal instability in the outer halo if the conductivity is not too high. alternatively such clumps may be embedded in dark matter subhaloes if the ionizing flux is ineffective but they separate from their subhaloes by ram pressure before entering the inner halo. heating by dynamical friction becomes dominant for massive satellites which can contribute up to one third of the total gravitational heating. we conclude that gravitational heating by cosmological accretion is a viable alternative to agn feedback as a long term quenching mechanism.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in this paper we present a joint cross correlation analysis of the archeops cmb maps at 143 and 217 ghz and the wmap cmb maps at 41 61 and 94 ghz with sky templates of projected galaxy density constructed from the 2mass extended source catalog. these templates have been divided in patches sorted in decreasing galaxy density with a fixed number of pixels  we considered patches having 32 64 and 128 pixels  and the cross correlation has been performed independently for each of these patches. we find that the densest patch shows a strong temperature decrement in the q v w bands of wmap and in the 143 ghz channel of archeops but not in the 217 ghz channel. furthermore we find that the spectral behavior of the amplitude of this decrement is compatible with that expected for the non relativistic thermal sunyaev zeldovich effect and is incompatible  at 4.5 sigma level  with the null hypothesis of having only cmb noise and a dust component  nu^2  in those pixels. we find that the first 32 pixel sized patch samples the cores of 11 known massive nearby galaxy clusters. under the assumption that the decrement found in this patch is due entirely to the thermal sunyaev zeldovich effect we obtain an average comptonization parameter for those sources of y =  0.41 +  0.08  x 10^  4  at 13 arcmin angular scales. this value is compatible at 1 sigma with the expectation y = 0.49 x 10^  4  from a model of the cluster flux number counts based on the standard lambda cdm cosmology. the observed value of y is slightly diluted when computed for the first patch of 64 and 128 pixels presumably due to the inclusion of less massive clusters and the dilution factor inferred is also compatible with the quoted model.  \n",

      "Abstract:   low mass helium core white dwarfs  m < 0.45 msun  can be produced from interacting binary systems and traditionally all of them have been attributed to this channel. however a low mass white dwarf could also result from a single star that experiences severe mass loss on the first ascent giant branch. a large population of low mass he core white dwarfs has been discovered in the old metal rich cluster ngc 6791. there is therefore a mechanism in clusters to produce low mass white dwarfs without requiring binary star interactions and we search for evidence of a similar population in field white dwarfs. we argue that there is a significant field population  of order half of the detected systems  that arises from old metal rich stars which truncate their evolution prior to the helium flash from severe mass loss. there is a consistent absence of evidence for nearby companions in a large fraction of low mass white dwarfs. the number of old metal rich field dwarfs is also comparable with the apparently single low mass white dwarf population and our revised estimate for the space density of low mass white dwarfs produced from binary interactions is also compatible with theoretical expectations. this indicates that this channel of stellar evolution hitherto thought hypothetical only has been in operation in our own galaxy for many billions of years. one strong implication of our model is that single low mass white dwarfs should be good targets for planet searches because they are likely to arise from metal rich progenitors. we also discuss other observational tests and implications including the potential impact on sn ia rates and the frequency of planetary nebulae.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in a solar flare a large fraction of the magnetic energy released is converted rapidly to the kinetic energy of non thermal particles and bulk plasma motion. this will likely result in non equilibrium particle distributions and turbulent plasma conditions. we investigate this by analysing the profiles of high temperature extreme ultraviolet emission lines from a major flare  sol2014 03 29t17 44  observed by the euv imaging spectrometer  eis  on hinode. we find that in many locations the line profiles are non gaussian consistent with a kappa distribution of emitting ions with properties that vary in space and time. at the flare footpoints close to sites of hard x ray emission from non thermal electrons the kappa index for the fe xvi 262.976 angstrom line at 3 mk takes values of 3 5. in the corona close to a low energy hxr source the fe xxiii 263.760 angstrom line at 15 mk shows kappa values of typically 4 7. the observed trends in the kappa parameter show that we are most likely detecting the properties of the ion population rather than any instrumental effects. we calculate that a non thermal ion population could exist if locally accelerated on timescales < 0.1 s. however observations of net redshifts in the lines also imply the presence of plasma downflows which could lead to bulk turbulence with increased non gaussianity in cooler regions. both interpretations have important implications for theories of solar flare particle acceleration.  \n",

      "Abstract:   a general rate estimation method is proposed that is based on studying the in sample evolution of appropriately chosen diverging/converging statistics. the proposed rate estimators are based on simple least squares arguments and are shown to be accurate in a very general setting without requiring the choice of a tuning parameter. the notion of scanning is introduced with the purpose of extracting useful subsamples of the data series; the proposed rate estimation method is applied to different scans and the resulting estimators are then combined to improve accuracy. applications to heavy tail index estimation as well as to the problem of estimating the long memory parameter are discussed; a small simulation study complements our theoretical results.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we describe a model of dark matter halo abundances and clustering which combines the two most widely used approaches to this problem  that based on peaks and the other based on excursion sets. our approach can be thought of as addressing the cloud in cloud problem for peaks and/or modifying the excursion set approach so that it averages over a special subset rather than all possible walks. in this respect it seeks to account for correlations between steps in the walk as well as correlations between walks. we first show how the excursion set and peaks models can be written in the same formalism and then use this correspondence to write our combined excursion set peaks model. we then give simple expressions for the mass function and bias showing that even the linear halo bias factor is predicted to be k dependent as a consequence of the nonlocality associated with the peak constraint. at large masses our model has little or no need to rescale the variable delta_c from the value associated with spherical collapse and suggests a simple explanation for why the linear halo bias factor appears to lie above that based on the peak background split at high masses when such a rescaling is assumed. although we have concentrated on peaks our analysis is more generally applicable to other traditionally single scale analyses of large scale structure.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the adaptive evolution of a population under the influence of mutation and selection is strongly influenced by the structure of the underlying fitness landscape which encodes the interactions between mutations at different genetic loci. theoretical studies of such landscapes have been carried out for several decades but only recently experimental fitness measurements encompassing all possible combinations of small sets of mutations have become available. the empirical studies have spawned new questions about the accessibility of optimal genotypes under natural selection. depending on population dynamic parameters such as mutation rate and population size evolutionary accessibility can be quantified through the statistics of accessible mutational pathways  along which fitness increases monotoncially  or through the study of the basin of attraction of the optimal genotype under greedy  steepest ascent  dynamics. here we investigate these two measures of accessibility in the framework of kauffmans  $ lk $  model a paradigmatic family of random fitness landscapes with tunable ruggedness. the key parameter governing the strength of genetic interactions is the number  $ k $  of interaction partners of each of the  $ l $  sites in the genotype sequence. in general accessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality  $ l $  and decreases with increasing number of interactions  $ k $ . remarkably however we find that some measures of accessibility behave non monotonically as a function of  $ k $  indicating a special role of the most sparsely connected non trivial cases k=1 and 2. the relation between models for fitness landscapes and spin glasses is also addressed.  \n",

      "Abstract:   to be the fittest is central to proliferation in evolutionary games. individuals thus adopt the strategies of better performing players in the hope of successful reproduction. in structured populations the array of those that are eligible to act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighbors of each individual. but which one of these strategy sources should potentially be copied  previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the fittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. here we introduce a parameter  $ u $  that interpolates between these two extreme options. setting  $ u $  equal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent while positive  $ u $  favor the fitter players. in addition we divide the population into two groups. players from group  $ a $  select their opponents as dictated by the parameter  $ u $  while players from group  $ b $  do so randomly irrespective of  $ u $ . we denote the fraction of players contained in groups  $ a $  and  $ b $  by  $ v $  and  $ 1 v $  respectively. the two parameters  $ u $  and  $ v $  allow us to analyze in detail how aspirations in the context of the prisoners dilemma game influence the evolution of cooperation. we find that for sufficiently positive values of  $ u $  there exist a robust intermediate  $ v \\approx 0.5 $  for which cooperation thrives best. the robustness of this observation is tested against different levels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process  $ k $  and for different interaction networks. we also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the dependence of the impact of  $ u $  and  $ v $  for different values of  $ k $  and contrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where individual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. our study indicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability of cooperation in structured populations.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the isolation with migration  im  model is a common tool to make inferences about the presence of gene flow during speciation using polymorphism data. however becquet and przeworski  2009  report that the parameter estimates obtained by fitting the im model are very sensitive to the models assumptions including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present. this paper is concerned with the isolation with initial migration  iim  model of wilkinson herbots  2012  which drops precisely this assumption. in the iim model one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period of isolation. we derive a fast method of fitting an extended version of the iim model which allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal subpopulation sizes. this is a maximum likelihood method applicable to observations on the number of different sites between pairs of dna sequences from a large number of independent loci. in addition to obtaining parameter estimates our method can also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different evolutionary cenarios by means of likelihood ratio tests. we illustrate the procedure on pairs of drosophila sequences from approximately 30000 loci. the computing time needed to fit the most complex version of the model to this data set is only a couple of minutes. the code to fit the iim model can be found in the supplementary files of this paper.  \n",

      "Abstract:   distributed computing models typically assume reliable communication between processors. while such assumptions often hold for engineered networks e.g. due to underlying error correction protocols their relevance to biological systems wherein messages are often distorted before reaching their destination is quite limited. in this study we take a first step towards reducing this gap by rigorously analyzing a model of communication in large anonymous populations composed of simple agents which interact through short and highly unreliable messages.   we focus on the broadcast problem and the majority consensus problem. both are fundamental information dissemination problems in distributed computing in which the goal of agents is to converge to some prescribed desired opinion. we initiate the study of these problems in the presence of communication noise. our model for communication is extremely weak and follows the push gossip communication paradigm  in each round each agent that wishes to send information delivers a message to a random anonymous agent. this communication is further restricted to contain only one bit  essentially representing an opinion . lastly the system is assumed to be so noisy that the bit in each message sent is flipped independently with probability  $ 1/2 \\epsilon $  for some small  $ \\epsilon >0 $ .   even in this severely restricted stochastic and noisy setting we give natural protocols that solve the noisy broadcast and the noisy majority consensus problems efficiently. our protocols run in  $ o \\log n / \\epsilon^2  $  rounds and use  $ o n \\log n / \\epsilon^2  $  messages/bits in total where  $ n $  is the number of agents. these bounds are asymptotically optimal and in fact are as fast and message efficient as if each agent would have been simultaneously informed directly by an agent that knows the prescribed desired opinion.  \n",

      "Abstract:   helices are a key folding motif in protein structure. the question which factors determine helix stability for a given polypeptide or protein is an ongoing challenge. here we use van der waals corrected density functional theory to address a part of this question in a bottom up approach. we show how intrinsic helical structure is stabilized with length and temperature for a series of experimentally well studied unsolvated alanine based polypeptides ac alan lysh+. by exploring extensively the conformational space of these molecules we find that helices emerge as the preferred structure in the length range n=4 8 not just due to enthalpic factors  hydrogen bonds and their cooperativity van der waals dispersion interactions electrostatics  but importantly also by a vibrational entropic stabilization over competing conformers at room temperature. the stabilization is shown to be due to softer low frequency vibrational modes in helical conformers than in more compact ones. this observation is corroborated by including anharmonic effects explicitly through \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics and generalized by testing different terminations and considering larger helical peptide models.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in this paper we study the infall by dynamical friction of rigid satellites taken in a variety of initial configurations and models. we thus measure how dynamical friction depends on the density concentration and on the pressure anisotropy of the host galaxy and separately the response of the galaxy during the process.   the investigation is carried out by using a numerical laboratory set up in previous papers of this series.   we find that the pressure anisotropy present in the host galaxy has little effect on dynamical friction. instead the shape of the galaxy density profile is very important. the classical idealized description appears to be applicable to galaxy models characterized by a small density gradient but not to concentrated models. in contrast to the behavior found in small density gradient models the orbits of satellites captured in concentrated models are not circularized by dynamical friction.   the induced evolution in the host galaxy reflects the initial conditions adopted for the captured satellite. satellites spiraling in on quasi circular orbits tend to modify the pressure tensor of the host galaxy in the tangential direction and the galaxy shape from spherical to oblate while satellites captured along quasi radial orbits tend to induce pressure anisotropy in the radial direction and to generate a prolate shape. this result suggests that the shape of early type galaxies may result from occasional mergers rather than being directly related to the effectiveness of the radial orbit instability during the process of formation via collisionless collapse as often argued in the past.  \n",

      "Abstract:   beppo}sax contributed substantially to our understanding of the physics of blazars. this has been made possible mainly by its wide energy range and especially by its high energy detector. together with the information coming from still higher energies we know at last the entire spectral energy distribution  sed  of blazars. different subclasses of blazars have different seds which seem to form a sequence whose main parameter is the bolometric luminosity. physically the blazar sequence can be the result of different cooling rates by those electrons emitting most of the radiation we see. blazars are among the most active sources we know of and the coordinated variability at high energies gives very important clues about the physics of their jets  initially they must transport energy in a dissipationless way. they radiate most of the entire bolometric luminosity we see at a preferred distance of a few hundreds of schwarzchild radii.for powerful blazars the emitted radiation must be a small fraction of the power transported by the jet since the bulk of it is required to energize the radio lobes. these are the jets which likely have bulk relativistic speeds up to hundreds of kiloparsecs as suggested by the bright x ray knots detected by chandra in many extended jets.  \n",

      "Abstract:   massive outflows driven by active galactic nuclei  agn  are widely recognised to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies heating the ambient gas expelling it from the nuclear regions and thereby affecting the star formation histories of the galaxy bulges. it has been proposed that the powerful jets of relativistic particles launched by some agn can both accelerate and heat the molecular gas which often dominates the mass budgets of the outflows. however clear evidence for this mechanism in the form of detailed associations between the molecular gas kinematics and features in the radio emitting jets has been lacking. here we show that the warm molecular hydrogen gas in the western radio lobe of the seyfert galaxy ic5063 is moving at high velocities   up to 600 km/s   relative to the galaxy disk. this suggests that the molecules have been accelerated by fast shocks driven into the interstellar medium  ism  by the expanding radio jets. these results demonstrate the general feasibility of accelerating molecular outflows in fast shocks driven by agn.  \n",

[phys. rev. lett. 86 5377 {2001}] for la2cuo4. the ring exchange terms are found essential in particular to determine the relative sign of t and t with the values found in good agreement with independent theoretical and experimental estimates for other members of the cuprate family. the zero temperature sublattice magnetization is calculated using these parameters and also found to be in good agreement with the experimental value estimated by lee et al.

      "Abstract:   in astrophysical environments with intense neutrino fluxes neutrino neutrino forward scattering contributes both diagonal and off diagonal potentials to the flavor basis hamiltonian that governs neutrino flavor evolution. we examine a special case where adiabatic flavor evolution can produce an off diagonal potential from neutrino neutrino forward scattering that dominates over both the corresponding diagonal term and the potential from neutrino matter forward scattering. in this case we find a solution that unlike the ordinary mikeyhev smirnov wolfenstein scenario has both neutrinos and antineutrinos maximally mixed in medium over appreciable ranges of neutrino and antineutrino energy. employing the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences we identify the conditions on neutrino fluxes that are required for this solution to exist deep in the supernova environment where it could affect the neutrino signal heavy element nucleosynthesis and even the revival of the supernova shock. we speculate on how this solution might or might not be attained in realistic supernova evolution. though this solution is ephemeral in time and/or space in supernovae it may signal the onset of subsequent appreciable flavor mixing for both neutrinos and antineutrinos. a similar solution may also exist in an early universe with significant net neutrino lepton numbers.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in this paper we obtain exact asymptotically anti de sitter black hole solutions and asymptotically lifshitz black hole solutions with dynamical exponents  $ z=0 $  and  $ z=4 $  of four dimensional conformal gravity coupled with a self interacting conformally invariant scalar field. then we compute their thermodynamical quantities such as the mass the wald entropy and the hawking temperature. the mass expression is obtained by using the generalized off shell noether potential formulation. it is found that the anti de sitter black holes as well as the lifshitz black holes with  $ z=0 $  have zero mass and zero entropy although they have non zero temperature. a similar behavior has been observed in previous works where the integration constant is not associated with a conserved charge and it can be interpreted as a kind of gravitational hair. on the other hand the lifshitz black holes with dynamical exponent  $ z=4 $  have non zero conserved charges and the first law of black hole thermodynamics holds. also we analyze the horizon thermodynamics for the lifshitz black holes with  $ z=4 $  and we show that the first law of black hole thermodynamics arises from the field equations evaluated on the horizon. furthermore we study the propagation of a conformally coupled scalar field on these backgrounds and we find the quasinormal modes analytically in several cases. we find that for anti de sitter black holes and lifshitz black holes with  $ z=4 $  there is a continuous spectrum of frequencies for dirichlet boundary condition; however we show that discrete sets of well defined quasinormal frequencies can be obtained by considering neumann boundary conditions.  \n",

      "Abstract:   in multibody simulation the gear gupta leimkuhler method for only persistent contacts enforces constraints on position and velocity level at the same time. it yields a robust numerical discretization of differential algebraic equations avoiding the drift off effect. in this work we carry over these benefits to impacting mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. for this kind of a mechanical system adding the position level constraint to a timestepping scheme on velocity level even maintains physical consistency of the impulsive discretization. hence we propose a timestepping scheme based on moreaus midpoint rule which enables to achieve not only compliance of the impact law but also of the non penetration constraint. the choice of a decoupled and consecutive evaluation of the respective constraints can be interpreted as a not energy consistent projection to the non penetration constraint at the end of each time step. it is the implicit coupling of position and velocity level which yields satisfactory results. an implicit evaluation of the right hand side improves stability properties without additional cost. with the prox function formulation the overall set of nonsmooth equations is solved by a newton scheme. results from simulations of a slider crank mechanism with unilateral constraints demonstrate the capability of our approach.  \n",

      "Abstract:   adaptation is a central topic in theoretical biology of practical importance for analyzing drug resistance mutations. several authors have used arguments based on extreme value theory in their work on adaptation. there are complications with these approaches if fitness is additive  meaning that fitness effects of mutations sum  or whenever there is more additivity than what one would expect in an uncorrelated fitness landscape. however the approaches have been used in published work even in situations with substantial amounts of additivity. in particular extreme value theory has been used in discussions on evolutionary predictability. we say that evolution is predictable if the use of a particular drug at different locations tends lead to the same resistance mutations. evolutionary predictability depends on the probabilities of mutational trajectories. arguments about probabilities based on extreme value theory can be misleading. additivity may cause errors in estimates of the probabilities of some mutational trajectories by a factor 20 even for rather small examples. we show that additivity gives systematic errors so as to exaggerate the differences between the most and the least likely trajectory. as a result of this bias evolution may appear more predictable than it is. from a broader perspective our results suggest that approaches which depend on the orr gillespie theory are likely to give misleading results for realistic fitness landscapes whenever one considers adaptation in several steps.  \n",

      "Abstract:   to solve deep metric learning problems and producing feature embeddings current methodologies will commonly use a triplet model to minimise the relative distance between samples from the same class and maximise the relative distance between samples from different classes. though successful the training convergence of this triplet model can be compromised by the fact that the vast majority of the training samples will produce gradients with magnitudes that are close to zero. this issue has motivated the development of methods that explore the global structure of the embedding and other methods that explore hard negative/positive mining. the effectiveness of such mining methods is often associated with intractable computational requirements. in this paper we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the triplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. we rely on a smart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low computational cost. in addition we propose an adaptive controller that automatically adjusts the smart mining hyper parameters and speeds up the convergence of the training process. we show empirically that our proposed method allows for fast and more accurate training of triplet convnets than other competing mining methods. additionally we show that our method achieves new state of the art embedding results for cub 200 2011 and cars196 datasets.  \n",

      "Abstract:   it is well known that an implicit equation of the offset to a rational planar curve can be computed by removing the extraneous components of the resultant of two certain polynomials computed from the parametrization of the curve. furthermore it is also well known that the implicit equation provided by the non extraneous component of this resultant has at most two irreducible factors. in this paper we complete the algebraic description of this resultant by showing that the multiplicity of the factors corresponding to the offset can be computed in advance. in particular when the parametrization is proper i.e. when the curve is just traced once by the parametrization we prove that any factor corresponding to a simple component of the offset has multiplicity 1 while the factor corresponding to the special component if any has multiplicity 2. hence if the parametrization is proper and there is no special component the non extraneous part of the resultant is square free. in fact this condition is proven to be also sufficient. additionally this result provides a simple test to check whether or not a given rational curve is the offset of another curve.  \n",

      "Abstract:   recent studies of the performance of radio frequency  rf  copper cavities operated at cryogenic temperatures have shown a dramatic increase in the maximum achievable surface electric field. we propose to exploit this development to enable a new generation of photoinjectors operated at cryogenic temperatures that may attain through enhancement of the launch field at the photocathode a significant increase in five dimensional electron beam brightness. we present detailed studies of the beam dynamics associated with such a system by examining an s band photoinjector operated at 250 mv/m peak electric field that reaches normalized emittances in the 40 nm rad range at charges  100 200 pc  suitable for use in a hard x ray free electron laser  xfel  scenario based on the lcls. in this case we show by start to end simulations that the properties of this source may give rise to high efficiency operation of an xfel and permit extension of the photon energy reach by an order of magnitude to over 80 kev. the brightness needed for such xfels is achieved through low source emittances in tandem with high current after compression. in the xfel examples analyzed the emittances during final compression are preserved using micro bunching techniques. extreme low emittance scenarios obtained at pc charge appropriate for significantly extending temporal resolution limits of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy experiments are also reviewed. while the increase in brightness in a cryogenic photoinjector is mainly due to the augmentation of the emission current density via field enhancement further possible increases in performance arising from lowering the intrinsic cathode emittance in cryogenic operation are also analyzed. issues in experimental implementation including cavity optimization for lowering cryogenic thermal dissipation external coupling and cryo cooler system are discussed.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the set of orbital elements available for chemically peculiar red giant  prg  stars has been considerably enlarged thanks to a decade long coravel radial velocity monitoring of about 70 barium stars and 50 s stars. this paper presents a detailed analysis of the complete set of orbital parameters available for prg stars; the individual data are given in three companion papers. the main results are as follows   i  the similarity between the orbital parameters of tc poor s stars and barium stars confirms that tc poor s stars are the cooler analogs of barium stars;  ii  the eccentricity    period diagram of prg stars clearly bears the signature of dissipative processes associated with mass transfer;  iii  the mass function distribution is compatible with the unseen companion being a white dwarf  wd ;  iv  assuming that the wd companion has a mass in the range 0.60+ 0.04 msun the masses of mild and strong barium stars amount to 1.9+ 0.2 and 1.5+ 0.2 msun respectively;  v  mild barium stars are not restricted to long period systems; the difference between mild and strong barium stars is mainly one of galactic population rather than of orbital separation in agreement with their respective kinematical properties;  vi  binarity is probably not a sufficient condition to produce a prg star and a metallicity lower than solar seems to be required as well.  \n",

      "Abstract:   achieving macroscopic directed migration of microscale swimmers in a fluid is an important step towards utilizing their autonomous motion. it has been experimentally shown that directed motion can be induced without any external fields by certain geometrically asymmetric obstacles due to interaction between their boundaries and the swimmers. in this paper we propose a kinetic type model to study swimming and directional migration of microscale bimetallic rods in a periodic array of posts with non circular cross sections. both rod position and orientation are taken into account; rod trapping and release on the post boundaries are modeled by empirically characterizing curvature and orientational dependence of the boundary absorption and desorption. intensity of the directed rod migration which we call the normalized net flux is then defined and computed given the geometry of the post array. we numerically study the effect of post spacings on the flux; we also apply shape optimization to find better post shapes that can induce stronger flux. inspired by preliminary numerical results on two candidate posts we perform an approximate analysis on a simplified model to show the key geometric features a good post should have. based on that three new candidate shapes are proposed which give rise to large fluxes. this approach provides an effective tool and guidance for experimentally designing new devices that induce strong directed migration of microscale swimmers.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we consider optimal mechanism design for the case with one buyer and two items. the buyers valuations towards the two items are independent and additive. in this setting optimal mechanism is unknown for general valuation distributions. we obtain two categories of structural results that shed light on the optimal mechanisms.   the first category of results state that under certain mild condition the optimal mechanism has a monotone menu. in other words in the menu that represents the optimal mechanism as payment increases the allocation probabilities for both items increase simultaneously. applying this theorem we derive a version of revenue monotonicity theorem that states stochastically superior distributions yield more revenue. moreover our theorem subsumes a previous result regarding sufficient conditions under which bundling is optimal. the second category of results state that under certain conditions the optimal mechanisms have few menu items. our first result in this category says for certain distributions the optimal menu contains at most 4 items. the condition admits power  including uniform  density functions. based on a similar proof of this result we are able to obtain a wide class of distributions where bundling is optimal. our second result in this category works for a weaker condition under which the optimal menu contains at most 6 items. this condition includes exponential density functions. our last result in this category works for unit demand setting. it states that for uniform distributions the optimal menu contains at most 5 items. all these results are in sharp contrast to hart and nisans recent result that finite sized menu cannot guarantee any positive fraction of optimal revenue for correlated valuation distributions.  \n",

      "Abstract:   it has long been known that two dimensional metals with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions have a weak coupling instability to the superconductivity of spin singlet d wave electron pairs. we examine additional possible instabilities in the spin singlet particle hole channel and study their interplay with superconductivity. we perform an unrestricted hartree fock bcs analysis of bond order parameters in a single band model on the square lattice with nearest neighbor exchange and repulsion while neglecting on site interactions. the dominant particle hole instability is found to be an incommensurate bi directional bond density wave with wavevectors along the  11  and  1 1  directions and an internal d wave symmetry. the magnitude of the ordering wavevector is close to the separation between points on the fermi surface which intersect the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary. the temperature dependence of the superconducting and bond order parameters demonstrates their mutual competition. we also obtain the spatial dependence of the two orders in a vortex lattice induced by an applied magnetic field  halos of the bond order appear around the cores of the vortices.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we present a differential study of 500 magellanic cepheids with 3 million measurements obtained as a by product of the eros microlensing survey. the data set is unbiased and provides an excellent basis for a differential analysis between lmc and smc. we investigate the pulsational properties of the cepheids as a function of metallicity and the constraints they give to stellar pulsation stellar evolution theory and opacities. moreover our empirical analysis shows a small metallicity effect on the period luminosity relation which has a significant implication to recent distance estimates based on hst observations of cepheids in galaxies as far as the virgo cluster. when the color shift of cepheids due to metallicity is interpreted as reddening in the determination of the true distance modulus of a target galaxy a systematic error is made. accounting for that error makes the low h_0 values  sandage et al.  higher and the high h_0  freedman et al.  value lower bringing those discrepant estimates into agrement around  $ h_0 \\approx 70 $  km/s mpc^{ 1}.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we consider the general problem of minimizing an objective function which is the sum of a convex function  not strictly convex  and absolute values of a subset of variables  or equivalently the l1 norm of the variables . this problem appears exten  sively in modern statistical applications associated with high dimensional data or big data and corresponds to optimizing l1 regularized likelihoods in the context of model selection. in such applications cyclic coordinatewise minimization  ccm  where the objective function is sequentially minimized with respect to each individual coordi  nate is often employed as it offers a computationally cheap and effective optimization method. consequently it is crucial to obtain theoretical guarantees of convergence for the sequence of iterates produced by the cyclic coordinatewise minimization in this setting. moreover as the objective corresponds to at l1 regularized likelihoods of many variables it is important to obtain convergence of the iterates themselves and not just the function values. previous results in the literature only establish either  i  that every limit point of the sequence of iterates is a stationary point of the objective function or  ii  establish convergence under special assumptions or  iii  establish con  vergence for a different minimization approach  which uses quadratic approximation based gradient descent followed by an inexact line search   iv  establish convergence of only the function values of the sequence of iterates produced by random coordinatewise minimization  a variant of ccm . in this paper a rigorous general proof of convergence for the cyclic coordinatewise minimization algorithm is provided. we demonstrate the usefulness of our general results in contemporary applications.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the low energy spectral slopes of the prompt emission of most gamma ray bursts  grbs  are difficult to reconcile with radiatively efficient optically thin emission models irrespective of the radiation mechanism. an alternative is to ascribe the radiation around the spectral peak to a thermalization process occurring well inside the thomson photosphere. this quasi thermal spectrum can evolve into the observed non thermal shape by additional energy release at moderate to small thomson optical depths which can readily give rise to the hard spectral tail. the position of the spectral peak is determined by the temperature and lorentz factor of the flow in the termalization zone where the total number of photons carried by the jet is established. to reach thermalization dissipation alone is not sufficient and photon generation requires an efficient emission/absorption process in addition to scattering. we perform a systematic study of all relevant photon production mechanisms searching for possible conditions in which thermalization can take place. we find that a significant fraction of the available energy should be dissipated at intermediate radii  $ \\sim 10^{10} $    a few $ \\times 10^{11} $  cm and the flow there should be relatively slow  the bulk lorentz factor could not exceed a few tens for all but the most luminous bursts with the highest  $ \\epk $  s. the least restrictive constraint for successful thermalization  $ \\gamma\\lesssim 20 $  is obtained if synchrotron emission acts as the photon source. this requires however a non thermal acceleration deep below the thomson photosphere transferring a significant fraction of the flow energy to relativistic electrons with lorentz factors between 10 and 100. other processes require bulk flow lorentz factors of order of a few for typical bursts. we examine the implications of these results to different grb photospheric emission models.  \n",

      "Abstract:   recently [bhattacharya et al. stoc 2015] provide the first non trivial algorithm for the densest subgraph problem in the streaming model with additions and deletions to its edges i.e. for dynamic graph streams. they present a  $  0.5 \\epsilon  $  approximation algorithm using  $ \\tilde{o} n  $  space where factors of  $ \\epsilon $  and  $ \\log n  $  are suppressed in the  $ \\tilde{o} $  notation. however the update time of this algorithm is large. to remedy this they also provide a  $  0.25 \\epsilon  $  approximation algorithm using  $ \\tilde{o} n  $  space with update time  $ \\tilde{o} 1  $ .   in this paper we improve the algorithms by bhattacharya et al. by providing a  $  1 \\epsilon  $  approximation algorithm using  $ \\tilde{o} n  $  space. our algorithm is conceptually simple   it samples  $ \\tilde{o} n  $  edges uniformly at random and finds the densest subgraph on the sampled graph. we also show how to perform this sampling with update time  $ \\tilde{o} 1  $ . in addition to this we show that given oracle access to the edge set we can implement our algorithm in time  $ \\tilde{o} n  $  on a graph in the standard ram model. to the best of our knowledge this is the fastest  $  0.5 \\epsilon  $  approximation algorithm for the densest subgraph problem in the ram model given such oracle access.   further we extend our results to a general class of graph optimization problems that we call heavy subgraph problems. this class contains many interesting problems such as densest subgraph directed densest subgraph densest bipartite subgraph  $ d $  cut and  $ d $  heavy connected component. our result by characterizing heavy subgraph problems partially addresses open problem 13 at the iitk workshop on algorithms for data streams in 2006 regarding the effects of subsampling in this context.  \n",

      "Abstract:   thermalization is investigated for the one dimensional anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with dimerized nearest neighbor interactions that break integrability. for this purpose the time evolution of local operator expectation values after an interacting quench is calculated directly with the chebyshev polynomial expansion and the deviation of the diagonal from the canonical thermal ensemble value is calculated for increasing system size for these operators. the spatial and spin symmetries of the hamiltonian are taken into account to divide it into symmetry subsectors. the rate of thermalization is found to weaken with the dimerization parameter as the hamiltonian evolves between two integrable limits the non dimerized and the fully dimerized where the chain breaks up into isolated dimers. this conclusion is supported by the distribution of the local operator off diagonal elements between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with respect to their energy difference which determines the strength of temporal fluctuations. the off diagonal elements have a low energy peak for small dimerization which facilitates thermalization and originates in the reduction of spatial symmetry with respect to the non dimerized limit. for increasing dimerization their distribution changes and develops a single low energy maximum that relates to the fully dimerized limit and slows down thermalization.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the extended kalman filter is perhaps the most standard tool to estimate in real time the state of a dynamical system from noisy measurements of some function of the system with extensive practical applications  such as position tracking via gps . while the plain kalman filter for linear systems is well understood the extended kalman filter relies on linearizations which have been debated.   we recover the exact extended kalman filter equations from first principles in statistical learning  the extended kalman filter is equal to amaris online natural gradient applied in the space of trajectories of the system. namely each possible trajectory of the dynamical system defines a probability law over possible observations. in principle this makes it possible to treat the underlying trajectory as the parameter of a statistical model of the observations. then the parameter can be learned by gradient ascent on the log likelihood of observations as they become available. using amaris natural gradient from information geometry  a gradient descent preconditioned with the fisher matrix which provides parameterization invariance  exactly recovers the extended kalman filter.   this applies only to a particular choice of process noise in the kalman filter namely taking noise proportional to the posterior covariance   a canonical choice in the absence of specific model information.  \n",

      "Abstract:   the possibility to extract properties of an interface between two immiscible liquids e.g. electrolyte solutions or polyelectrolyte multilayers by means of impedance spectroscopy is investigated theoretically within a dynamic density functional theory which is equivalent to the nernst planck poisson theory. a novel approach based on a two step fitting procedure of an equivalent circuit to impedance spectra is proposed which allows to uniquely separate bulk and interfacial elements. moreover the proposed method avoids overfitting of the bulk properties of the two liquids in contact and underfitting of the interfacial properties as they might occur for standard one step procedures. the key idea is to determine the bulk elements of the equivalent circuit in a first step by fitting corresponding sub circuits to the spectra of uniform electrolyte solutions and afterwards fitting the full equivalent circuit with fixed bulk elements to the impedance spectrum containing the interface. this approach is exemplified for an equivalent circuit which leads to a physically intuitive qualitative behavior as well as to quantitively realistic values of the interfacial elements. the proposed method is robust such that it can be expected to be applicable to a wide class of systems with liquid liquid interfaces.  \n",

      "Abstract:   fragmentation of highly differentially rotating massive stars that undergo collapse has been suggested as a possible channel for binary black hole formation. such a scenario could explain the formation of the new population of massive black holes detected by the ligo/virgo gravitational wave laser interferometers. we probe that scenario by performing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars supported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. the stars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak poloidal magnetic field confined to the stellar interior. we find that magnetic braking and turbulent viscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in the bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum damp differential rotation and induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core surrounded by a keplerian envelope. the core + disk configuration evolves on a secular timescale and remains in quasi stationary equilibrium until the termination of our simulations. our results suggest that the high degree of differential rotation required for  $ m=2 $  seed density perturbations to trigger gas fragmentation and binary black hole formation is likely to be suppressed during the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving to the point of dynamical instability to collapse. other cataclysmic events such as stellar mergers leading to collapse may therefore be necessary to reestablish sufficient differential rotation and density perturbations to drive nonaxisymmetric modes leading to binary black hole formation.  \n",

      "Abstract:   when studying networks using random graph models one is sometimes faced with situations where the notion of adjacency between nodes reflects multiple constraints. traditional random graph models are insufficient to handle such situations.   a simple idea to account for multiple constraints consists in taking the intersection of random graphs. in this paper we initiate the study of random graphs so obtained through a simple example. we examine the intersection of an erdos renyi graph and of one dimensional geometric random graphs. we investigate the zero one laws for the property that there are no isolated nodes. when the geometric component is defined on the unit circle a full zero one law is established and we determine its critical scaling. when the geometric component lies in the unit interval there is a gap in that the obtained zero and one laws are found to express deviations from different critical scalings. in particular the first moment method requires a larger critical scaling than in the unit circle case in order to obtain the one law. this discrepancy is somewhat surprising given that the zero one laws for the absence of isolated nodes are identical in the geometric random graphs on both the unit interval and unit circle.  \n",

      "Abstract:   maximum mutual information  mmi  is a model selection criterion used for hidden markov model  hmm  parameter estimation that was developed more than twenty years ago as a discriminative alternative to the maximum likelihood criterion for hmm based speech recognition. it has been shown in the speech recognition literature that parameter estimation using the current mmi paradigm lattice based mmi consistently outperforms maximum likelihood estimation but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties. in particular recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that the iterative mmi estimation algorithm extended baum welch is performed. in fact too many iterations of extended baum welch will lead to degraded performance despite the fact that the mmi criterion improves at each iteration. this phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of maximum likelihood estimation    at least for the hmms used in speech recognition    and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting. in this paper we present an analysis of lattice based mmi that demonstrates first of all that the asymptotic behavior of lattice based mmi is much worse than was previously understood i.e. it does not appear to converge at all and second of all that this is not due to `over fitting. instead we demonstrate that the `over fitting phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that exacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice based mmi machinery. we also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology to improve the validity of these approximations then the convergence properties of lattice based mmi become benign without sacrificing improvements to recognition accuracy.  \n",

      "Abstract:   levy copulas are the most general concept to capture jump dependence in multivariate levy processes. they translate the intuition and many features of the copula concept into a time series setting. a challenge faced by both distributional and levy copulas is to find flexible but still applicable models for higher dimensions. to overcome this problem the concept of pair copula constructions has been successfully applied to distributional copulas. in this paper we develop the pair construction for levy copulas  plcc . similar to pair constructions of distributional copulas the pair construction of a d dimensional levy copula consists of d d 1 /2 bivariate dependence functions. we show that only d 1 of these bivariate functions are levy copulas whereas the remaining functions are distributional copulas. since there are no restrictions concerning the choice of the copulas the proposed pair construction adds the desired flexibility to levy copula models. we discuss estimation and simulation in detail and apply the pair construction in a simulation study.  \n",

      "Abstract:   our understanding of magnetic fields in late type stars is strongly driven by what we know of the solar magnetic field. for this reason it is crucial to understand how typical the solar dynamo is. to do this we need to compare the solar magnetic field with that of other stars as similar to the sun as possible both in stellar parameters and age hence activity. we present here the detection of a magnetic field in three planet hosting solar like stars having a mass age and activity level comparable to that of the sun. we used the harpspol spectropolarimeter to obtain high resolution high quality circularly polarised spectra of hd 70642 hd 117207 and hd 154088 using the least squares deconvolution technique to detect the magnetic field. from the stokes i spectra we calculated the logr activity index for each star. we compared the position of the stars in the hertzsprung russell diagram to evolutionary tracks to estimate their mass and age. we used the lithium abundance derived from the stokes i spectra to further constrain the ages. we obtained a definite magnetic field detection for both hd 70642 and hd 154088 while for hd 117207 we obtained a marginal detection. due to the lower signal to noise ratio of the observations we were unable to detect the magnetic field in the second set of observations available for hd 117207 and hd 154088. on the basis of effective temperature mass age and activity level the three stars can be considered solar analogs. hd 70642 hd 117207 and hd 154088 are ideal targets for a comparative study between the solar magnetic field and that of solar analogs.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we study the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games where besides the classical strategies of cooperation  c  and defection  d  we consider punishing cooperators  pc  or punishing defectors  pd  as an additional strategy. using a minimalist modeling approach our goal is to separately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishing strategies. since punishment is costly punishing strategies loose the evolutionary competition in case of well mixed interactions. when spatial interactions are taken into account however the outcome can be strikingly different and cooperation may spread. the underlying mechanism depends on the character of the punishment strategy. in case of cooperating punishers increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. in contrast in the presence of the pd strategy the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transition as the fine is increased. accordingly the level of cooperation shows a non monotonous dependence on the fine. remarkably punishing strategies can spread in both cases but based on largely different mechanisms which depend on the cooperativeness  or not  of punishers.  \n",

      "Abstract:   we review recent results on integrable discrete geometry. it turns out that most of the known  continuous and/or discrete  integrable systems are particular symmetries of the quadrilateral lattice a multidimensional lattice characterized by the planarity of its elementary quadrilaterals. therefore the linear property of planarity seems to be a basic geometric property underlying integrability. we present the geometric meaning of its tau function as the potential connecting its forward and backward data. we present the theory of transformations of the quadrilateral lattice which is based on the discrete analogue of the theory of rectilinear congruences. in particular we discuss the discrete analogues of the laplace combescure levy radial and fundamental transformations and their interrelations. we also show how the sequence of laplace transformations of a quadrilateral surface is described by the discrete toda system. we finally show that these classical transformations are strictly related to the basic operators associated with the quantum field theoretical formulation of the multicomponent kadomtsev petviashvilii hierarchy. we review the properties of quadrilateral hyperplane lattices which play an interesting role in the reduction theory when the introduction of additional geometric structures allows to establish a connection between point and hyperplane lattices. we present and fully characterize some geometrically distinguished reductions of the quadrilateral lattice like the symmetric circular and egorov lattices; we review also basic geometric results of the theory of quadrilateral lattices in quadrics and the corresponding analogue of the ribaucour reduction of the fundamental transformation.  \n",

      "Abstract:   a remarkable holographic feature of dynamics in ads space in five dimensions is that it is dual to hamiltonian theory in physical space time quantized at fixed light front time {\\tau} = t+z/c. this light front holographic principle provides a precise relation between the bound state amplitudes in ads space and the boost invariant light front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space time. the fifth dimension coordinate z is dual to the light front variable {\\zeta} describing the invariant separation of the quark constituents. the resulting valence fock state wavefunction eigensolutions of the light front qcd hamiltonian satisfy a single variable relativistic equation of motion analogous to the nonrelativistic radial schr\\odinger equation. the soft wall dilaton profile exp  {\\kappa}^2 {\\zeta}^2  provides a model for the light front potential which is color confining and reproduces well the linear regge behavior of the light quark hadron spectrum in both l the orbital angular momentum and n the radial node number. the pion mass vanishes in the chiral limit and other features of chiral symmetry are satisfied. the resulting running qcd coupling displays an infrared fixed point. the elastic and transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are also found to be well described in this framework. the light front ads/qcd holographic approach thus gives a frame independent analytic first approximation of the color confining dynamics spectroscopy and excitation spectra of relativistic light quark bound states in qcd.  \n",
